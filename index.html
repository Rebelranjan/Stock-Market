                            As the name suggests, a stock market is a marketplace where buyers and sellers meet to trade
                            i.e. buy
                            and sell shares of publicly listed companies.
                            A stock market is fondly known as a share market, equity
                            market or share bazaar. </p>

                        <p> In simple terms, if Ram wants to sell 10 shares of Reliance Industries at Rs 1990/ share, he
                            will place
                            a sell order on the stock. The stock exchange will then find a buyer who wants to buy 10
                            shares
                            of Reliance Industries at Rs 1990/ share. So, the stock market is a virtual market where the
                            buyers
                            and
                            sellers meet to trade shares. </p>

                        <p>Intraday trading is the practice of buying and selling stocks the same day you purchase them.
                            The
                            advantage of doing so is with short-term profits, however, the risk is also in proportion.
                            Suppose you buy 100 stocks at Rs. 300 and after a few hours the price of the stock goes to
                            Rs.
                            310. Taking advantage of this, you decide to sell those 100 stocks on the same day and earn
                            a
                            profit of Rs. 1,000. This is called intraday trading. </p>

                        </li>
                        <p>Multi-Cap Fund is an open-ended equity scheme that invests in shares of large-cap, mid-cap,
                            and small-cap companies. An open-ended scheme means that the mutual fund has no fixed
                            maturity period. The scheme is always available for subscription and redemption. A multi-cap
                            fund allocates a minimum of 65% of the total assets for equity & equity related instruments.
                            Multi-cap funds are the most diversified equity funds. Hence, you have a lower risk as
                            compared to individual large, mid or small-cap focused funds. You get the benefit of
                            stability from large-cap and returns from mid and small-cap stocks. Thus, with the multi-cap
                            fund, you have a stable portfolio with considerable returns. Multi-cap funds can be used to
                            create long-term wealth. These are of great value to create a multipurpose corpus.</p>

                            stocks
                            of large-cap companies. Large-cap mutual funds allocate a minimum of 80% of the pool for
                            investment in equity & equity related instruments of large-cap companies. The corpus of the
                            large-cap mutual fund is invested in stable companies with a long track record of robust
                            financial performance with established operations. They can have the lowest volatility among
                            equity mutual funds because large-cap companies’ stock prices fluctuate less and these
                            companies

                            fund consists of equity & equity related instruments of large-cap companies. Another 35% of
                            the assets are made up of equity & equity related instruments of mid-cap companies. Large
                            and midcap funds capture the stability offered by the large-cap stocks and the growth

                            invests in shares of mid-cap companies. Mid-cap mutual funds have a minimum investment of
                            65% of the total assets in equities & equity related instruments of the mid-cap companies.
                            The mid-cap companies are in a growing phase and have expansion plans. Hence, the mid-cap
                            mutual funds are more aggressive than large-cap mutual funds. The mid-cap mutual funds offer
                            higher returns but also carry a higher amount of risk due to investment in midcap companies.

                        <p>ELSS is an open-ended equity-linked savings scheme with a statutory lock-in of 3 years. ELSS
                            invests a minimum of 80% of total assets in equity & equity related instruments in
                            accordance with Equity Linked Saving Scheme, 2005 notified by the Ministry of Finance. ELSS
                            investments allow tax deductions of up to Rs. 1.5 Lakhs under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
                            Compared to other tax saving options ELSS have the lowest lock-in period of three years.
                            ELSS funds have a lock-in period that helps in the reinvestment of returns and ultimately
                            end up generating higher returns. Thus, ELSS serves the dual purpose of tax saving/ planning
                            and generating higher returns from equity investment. Apart from that, you benefit from
                            diversification, professional fund management and low-cost investment through SIP when you
                            invest in an ELSS fund.</p>\

                        Funds, Monthly Income Plans, Gilt Fund, Long Term Bonds, and more. All the fixed income

                    <p>These investments are considered to be safe as they possess low risk. However, the returns are
                        rarely inflation-beating. Further, in the case of debt funds, TDS (tax deducted at source) is
                        not deducted, so those earning more than Rs. 10,000 on their investment should pay the tax on

                            The overnight fund invests in overnight securities having a maturity of 1 day. They are
                            highly liquid and offer a highly safe investment avenue. Overnight funds help investors park

                            They are highly liquid and offer a highly safe investment avenue. A liquid mutual fund helps
                            you park excess money for a few weeks up to 3 months. Liquid funds are ideal for creating an
                            emergency fund for various life events like temporary financial crises from job loss and
                            medical emergencies. You can also use liquid funds to manage your monthly expenses and for

                            periodic interest as well as principal repayments. The Macaulay duration for a portfolio is
                            calculated as the weighted average time period over which the cash flows on its bond
                            holdings are received. Ultra-short duration fund invests in debt securities that have a

                            An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of pooled investment security that operates much
                            like a mutual
                            fund. Typically, ETFs will track a particular index, sector, commodity, or other assets, but
                            unlike
                            mutual funds, ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way that a regular
                            stock can.
                            An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a
                            large and
                            diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment
                            strategies.

                            An ETF is called an exchange-traded fund because it’s traded on an exchange just like stocks
                            are. The
                            price
                            of an ETF’s shares will change throughout the trading day as the shares are bought and sold
                            on the
                            market.
                            This is unlike mutual funds, which are not traded on an exchange, and which trade only once
                            per day
                            after
                            the markets close. Additionally, ETFs tend to be more cost-effective and more liquid
                            compared to mutual
                            funds.
